# ColorPicker

This is a simple color picker app for android. It uses the camera to capture a desired color for IRL and converts it into the numeric color representation that can be used for whatever purposes. For example, you might see a calm red that would look great as your blogs background color. You get the exact color and can then use it to create a digital background for your blog.
